# General Info

Burning Zombies is an algorithmically generated NFT collection on the Avalanche Network based on 36 hand-drawn traits. The generation consists of 3,024 zombies combined with three skins, seven backgrounds, eighteen eyes, and eight mouths. Then all of them are sorted by rarity scores defined to 69 hand-drawn accessories. Those accessories are assigned to zombies by their compatible traits developed at the beginning.

Burning Zombies offers three critically important benefits: community reflections, fair distribution, and high market potential. **The minting will be available for 10 days.** While mint is active, won't be possible to claim rewards until the end of the burning.

This restriction is planned to save the minters' passive income. The transfers in the custom marketplace or any other market are disabled during minting. After that, tokens can be tradeable in any market if approval is provided for the token.

When time is over, the rest of the tokens will be available for everyone to burn. Burning Zombies aimed at the community; everybody can burn the unclaimed token. It's a fast way to claim rewards. You don't have to wait for the contract owner for the burning process. The rewards are distributed to the community when the token is burned. After the burning of the last token, rewards will be claimable.

Burning Zombies uses a different system than Ponzi reflection methods in the market. Rewards cannot be looted by the first minters, which is not fair; instead, the community receives dividends fairly. **The planned sale price is 2 $AVAX**; check the tokenomics section for more information about prices and reflection amounts.
