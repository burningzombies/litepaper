# Rarity

Token rarities come from the accessories assigned to tokens. All accessories used a certain ratio in the whole collection and were set scores by their amount. The token which has the highest score is the rarest and valuable one. The owner mints ten rare tokens for future marketing purposes.

## Calculation of the Scores

The calculation refers to the average rarity of the trait, and the token rarity is the sum of trait scores.
