# Rarity

Token rarities come from the accessories assigned to tokens. All accessories used a certain ratio in the whole collection and were set scores by their amount. The token which has the highest score is the rarest and valuable one. The owner mints ten rare tokens for future marketing purposes.

Accessories are distributed to tokens fairly. All tokens are unique, and some are rare; as seen above, **~20% of tokens are rarer than the rest of the collection.** Rarity scores will be visible after the burning process.
